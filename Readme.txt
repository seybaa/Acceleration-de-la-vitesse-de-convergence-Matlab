2. Author: Mohamed Samou SAMAKE and Romain Le Touze
3. Status of the project: Version 1
4. Quick description: the project consists of studying the different methods of accelerating the speed of convergence of a numerical sequence and its implementation on Matlab.
5. Set up, use quick: download Matlab http://www.clubic.com/lance-le-charge-436277-0-matlab.html and install on your computer. The program consists of three main functions: the test () function which verifies the convergence, the Aitken () function which accelerates the convergence speed thanks to the AITKEN method and the last Richardson () which accelerates the speed thanks to the process Of RICHARDSON.
• Open Matlab.
• Give a whole series as a function of U (n) Example: U (n) = 1. /(n.*(n+1))
• Make test (U, n) to check the convergence
• Aitken (U, n) to accelerate the speed of convergence thanks to AITKEN
• Richardson (U, n) to accelerate the speed of convergence thanks to the RICHARDSON process

8. Upcoming Updates:
• Implementation of an executable (.exe) in python for the use of the program without necessarily having Matlab.
• Implementation of other methods Romberg, Newton, etc ...
